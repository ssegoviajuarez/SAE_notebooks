  abstract = {Summary The method of Elbers, Lanjouw and Lanjouw (ELL) is the small area estimation method developed by the World Bank for poverty mapping and is widely used in developing countries. However, it has been criticized because of its assumption of negligible between-area variability when used to calculate small area poverty estimates. In particular, the mean-squared errors (MSEs) of these estimates are significantly underestimated when this between-area variability cannot be adequately explained by the model covariates. A method of MSE estimation for ELL-type estimates is proposed which is robust to significant unexplained between-area variability. Simulation results show that the method proposed performs better than standard ELL MSE estimators when the area homogeneity assumption is violated. An application to a Bangladesh poverty mapping study provides some empirical evidence for this robustness.},

  abstract={Abstract Models with random (or mixed) effects are commonly used for panel data, in microarrays, small area estimation and many other applications. When the variable of interest is continuous, normality is commonly assumed, either in the original scale or after some transformation. However, the normal distribution is not always well suited for modeling data on certain variables, such as those found in Econometrics, which often show skewness even at the log scale. Finding the correct transformation to achieve normality is not straightforward since the true distribution is not known in practice. As an alternative, we propose to consider a much more flexible distribution called generalized beta of the second kind (GB2). The GB2 distribution contains four parameters with two of them controlling the shape of each tail, which makes it very flexible to accommodate different forms of skewness. Based on a multivariate extension of the GB2 distribution, we propose a new model with random effects designed for skewed response variables that extends the usual log-normal-nested error model. Under this new model, we find empirical best predictors of linear and nonlinear characteristics, including poverty indicators, in small areas. Simulation studies illustrate the good properties, in terms of bias and efficiency, of the estimators based on the proposed multivariate GB2 model. Results from an application to poverty mapping in Spanish provinces also indicate efficiency gains with respect to the conventional log-normal-nested error model used for poverty mapping.},

 abstract = {Knowledge of the area under different crops is important to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sample surveys have been designed to estimate crop areas for large regions, such as crop-reporting districts, individual states, and the United States as a whole. Predicting crop areas for small areas such as counties has generally not been attempted, due to a lack of available data from farm surveys for these areas. The use of satellite data in association with farm-level survey observations has been the subject of considerable research in recent years. This article considers (a) data for 12 Iowa counties, obtained from the 1978 June Enumerative Survey of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and (b) data obtained from land observatory satellites (LANDSAT) during the 1978 growing season. Emphasis is given to predicting the area under corn and soybeans in these counties. A linear regression model is specified for the relationship between the reported hectares of corn and soybeans within sample segments in the June Enumerative Survey and the corresponding satellite determination for areas under corn and soybeans. A nested-error model defines a correlation structure among reported crop hectares within the counties. Given this model, the mean hectares of the crop per segment in a county is defined as the conditional mean of reported hectares, given the satellite determinations and the realized (random) county effect. The mean hectares of the crop per segment is the sum of a fixed component, involving unknown parameters to be estimated and a random component to be predicted. Variance-component estimators in the nested-error model are defined, and the generalized least-squares estimators of the parameters of the linear model are obtained. Predictors of the mean crop hectares per segment are defined in terms of these estimators. An estimator of the variance of the error in the predictor is constructed, including terms arising from the estimation of the parameters of the model. Predictions of mean hectares of corn and soybeans per segment for the 12 Iowa counties are presented. Standard errors of the predictions are compared with those of competing predictors. The suggested predictor for the county mean crop area per segment has a standard error that is considerably less than that of the traditional survey regression predictor.},

   abstract = {Summary Poverty maps at local level might be misleading when based on direct (or area-specific) estimators obtained from a survey that does not cover adequately all the local areas of interest. In this case, small area estimation procedures based on assuming common models for all the areas typically provide much more reliable poverty estimates. These models include area effects to account for the unexplained between-area heterogeneity. When poverty figures are sought at two different aggregation levels, domains and subdomains, it is reasonable to assume a twofold nested error model including random effects explaining the heterogeneity at the two levels of aggregation. The paper introduces the empirical best (EB) method for poverty mapping or, more generally, for estimation of additive parameters in small areas, under a twofold model. Under this model, analytical expressions for the EB estimators of poverty incidences and gaps in domains or subdomains are given. For more complex additive parameters, a Monte Carlo algorithm is used to approximate the EB estimators. The EB estimates obtained of the totals for all the subdomains in a given domain add up to the EB estimate of the domain total. We develop a bootstrap estimator of the mean-squared error of EB estimators and study the effect on the mean-squared error of a misspecification of the area effects. In simulations, we compare the estimators obtained under the twofold model with those obtained under models with only domain effects or only subdomain effects, when all subdomains are sampled or when there are unsampled subdomains. The methodology is applied to poverty mapping in counties of the Spanish region of Valencia by gender. Results show great variation in the poverty incidence and gap across the counties from this region, with more counties affected by extreme poverty when restricting ourselves to women.},

Design-based simulation experiments are carried out using the Mexican Intra Censal survey as a census of roughly 3.9 million households from which 500 samples are drawn using a two-stage selection procedure similar to that of Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) surveys. The estimation methods considered are that of Elbers, Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2003), the empirical best predictor of Molina and Rao (2010), the twofold nested error extension presented by Marhuenda et al. (2017), and finally an adaptation, presented by Nguyen (2012), that combines unit and area level information, and which has been proposed as an alternative when the available census data is outdated. The findings show the importance of selecting a proper model and data transformation so that model assumptions hold. A proper data transformation can lead to a considerable improvement in mean squared error (MSE). Results from design-based validation show that all small area estimation methods represent an improvement, in terms of MSE, over direct estimates. However, methods that model unit level welfare using only area level information suffer from considerable bias. Because the magnitude and direction of the bias is unknown ex ante, methods relying only on aggregated covariates should be used with caution, but may be an alternative to traditional area level models when these are not applicable.},

This chapter provides a technical overview of the SAIPE program, summarizing the data, models, and methods used, and discussing some issues that have arisen for implementing the methods in a production environment. A key theme running throughout the chapter is the importance to small area estimation in practice of having data of good quality from which to develop small area models and predictions. To address the lack of suitable covariate data for school districts, recent SAIPE research has sought to extend the geocoding process so that all tax returns can be assigned to school districts.}

 abstract = {Small-area estimation has received considerable attention in recent years because of a growing demand for reliable small-area statistics. The direct-survey estimators, based only on the data from a given small area (or small domain), are likely to yield unacceptably large standard errors because of small sample size in the domain. Therefore, alternative estimators that borrow strength from other related small areas have been proposed in the literature to improve the efficiency. These estimators use models, either implicitly or explicitly, that connect the small areas through supplementary (e.g., census and administrative) data. For example, simple synthetic estimators are based on implicit modeling. In this article, three small-area models, of Battese, Harter, and Fuller (1988), Dempster, Rubin, and Tsutakawa (1981), and Fay and Herriot (1979), are investigated. These models are all special cases of a general mixed linear model involving fixed and random effects, and a small-area mean can be expressed as a linear combination of fixed effects and realized values of random effects. Using the general theory of Henderson (1975) for a mixed linear model, a two-stage estimator (or predictor) of a small-area mean under each model is obtained, by first deriving the best linear unbiased estimator (or predictor) assuming that the variance components that determine the variance-covariance matrix are known, and then replacing the variance components in the estimator with their estimators. Second-order approximation to the mean squared error (MSE) of the two-stage estimator and the estimator of MSE approximation are obtained under normality. Finally, the results of a Monte Carlo study on the efficiency of two-stage estimators and the accuracy of the proposed approximation to MSE and its estimator are summarized. The MSE approximation provides a reliable measure of uncertainty associated with the two-stage estimator. It can also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on a small-area mean, as the number of small areas tends to ∞.},

 abstract={The R package emdi enables the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation methods and includes tools for processing, assessing, and presenting the results. The mean of the target variable, the quantiles of its distribution, the headcount ratio, the poverty gap, the Gini coefficient, the quintile share ratio, and customized indicators are estimated using direct and model-based estimation with the empirical best predictor (Molina and Rao 2010). The user is assisted by automatic estimation of datadriven transformation parameters. Parametric and semi-parametric, wild bootstrap for mean squared error estimation are implemented with the latter offering protection against possible misspecification of the error distribution. Tools for (a) customized parallel computing, (b) model diagnostic analyses, (c) creating high quality maps and (d) exporting the results to Excel and OpenDocument Spreadsheets are included. The functionality of the package is illustrated with example data sets for estimating the Gini coefficient and median income for districts in Austria.},

  abstract = {Summary This chapter focuses on the central role played in small area estimation (SAE) by choice of contextual variables to control area-specific bias and regression variables to reduce standard errors. The marked reduction in standard errors in models such as ELL which use both unit record survey and census data, when they are compared with some other SAE methods, reflects in part an apparent focus in the published statistical literature on predicting rather than minimising random effects and standard errors. The chapter also highlights the central importance of sound and careful choice of regressors and contextual variables to minimise standard error and to control bias in any good model, whatever the choice of SAE method. Spatial models are an accepted part of mainstream statistical methods. Accuracy of small area estimates would be improved if sample surveys used for modelling were designed with small area estimates in mind.}
